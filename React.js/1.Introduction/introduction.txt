-> what are components?
    : components are the piece of UI. Every react app have alteast one component which 
        we refer to as root component and  other child components. These components are
        build separately then put together to form the complex UIs. This also makes
        components reusable.

-> Implementation of components:
    Components are implemented using javaScript class which have some state and a render
    method. The output of the render method is simple react element which is a plain js
    object that maps to a DOM element.

    It installs all the package necessary for the app with ZERO-CONFIG-SETUP.
    However we can define custom config by {npm run eject}. Running this command
    intall three major things: 1) Development Server 2) Webpack: for bundling our files
    3) Babel: for compiling our js code.
